# Hello, Xorld!
Welcome to a tour of the Wren scripting language.

The tour is divided into a list of curriculums that you can access by clicking on...

The tour is interactive. On the right-hand side of the screen you will see a code editor along with an area reserved for displaying the result of the code.

These example scripts demonstrate different aspects of Wren. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.

Edit the program and run it again.
